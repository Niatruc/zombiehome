# Zombiehome

Thanks for giving an attention to this project. This project is a DSL for conveniently manipulating data in database in different types (Oracle, MySql, Hbase, etc.). You can use expression in Ruby syntax rather than SQL to accomplish daily database work such as CURD. 

## Installation
* Way 1
1. Add the below line to your application's Gemfile:
	```ruby
	gem 'zombiehome'
	```
2. Execute `bundle`. 

* Way 2
    > $ gem install zombiehome

## Usage
### Configure
* Modify file `./conf/required_files` which will be loaded when `zombiehome` is loaded. This file allow `zombiehome` to load necessary libraries. For example, if you use `zombiehome` on JRuby Platform and you want to manage a Mysql instance, then the below line is necessary for loading a Mysql JDBC jar:
```ruby
require '/home/u/mysql_jar/mysql-connector-java-5.1.43-bin.jar'
```

* To connect to your database, you should write some configure items in a yml file seems, for example:
```yml
# my_config.yml
type: "mysql"
url: "DBI:Jdbc:mysql://192.168.1.100/mydb?useSSL=false"
user: "root"
password: "toor"
schema: "mydb"
driver: "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
```
* Specify your file name in `./conf/config.yml` file:
```yml
user_config_file_path: "/home/u/conf/my_config.yml"
```

* Besides, you can parse those configure items to `Zombiehome::DBFactory.create` method to create an functional instance.

### Programming
* Create a new `Zombiehome::ServerFactory` instance:
```ruby
lh = Zombiehome::MysqlDBFactory.create({
	type: 'mysql',
	url: 'localhost:3306/test',
	user: 'root',
	psw: 'root',
})
lht = lh.tables
```

* Perform CRUD actions. Suggest you have a mysql schema named as 'mySchema' and a 'users' table defined as below:
```sql
create table users (
	id varchar(30) primary key,
	first_name varchar(100),
	last_name varchar(100),
	gender char(1),
	birthday date,
	address varchar(10),
	description varchar(10)
)
```

Reading records:
```ruby
# Select records from 'users' table, from the 1st to the 11th.
users_list = lht.users.select(1, 10)

# Select one row by primary key. If a table have a composite primary key, put the pk value into an array in the order of how they are written when creating the table, and then pass the array to the `select` method.
me = lht.users.select(['00001', '00002'])  # if table has a single primary key
me = lht.users.select([[1, '0'], [2, '0']])  # if table has a composite primary key

# Use complicate conditions. 
# select 
# 	* 
# from 
# 	users 
# where 
# 	gender = '0' 
# 	and last_name in ('zhao', 'qian', 'sun', 'li')
# 	and birthday between '1990-01-01' and '2018-12-31'
# 	and address is not null
# 	first_name is like 'han%'
users = lht.users.select({
	gender: '0', 
	last_name: ['zhao', 'qian', 'sun', 'li'],
	birthday: '1990-01-01'..'2018-12-31',
	0 => "address is not null",
	1 => ["first_name is like ?", ["han%"]],
})

# If you need a `or` condition, then separate the criteria into two Hash instances
users = lht.users.select({
	birthday: '1990-01-01'..'2018-12-31',
}, {
	birthday: '1960-01-01'..'1980-01-01',
}) # means `birthday between '1990-01-01' and '2018-12-31' OR birthday between '1960-01-01' and '1980-01-01'`

```

In most case, a call to `select` method would return an array of beans, representing records from the related table.
```ruby
users.each do |user|
	puts(user.birthday) # invoke getter

	user.gender = 0 # invoke setter
end
```

* Insert/Update/Delete:
```ruby
lht.users.insert(user)
lht.users.insert([user1, user2]) # insert a batch of records

lht.users.update(user)
lht.users.update([user1, user2]) # update a batch of records

lht.users.delete(user)
lht.users.delete(user.id) # delete record by primary key
lht.users.delete([user1, user2]) # delete a batch of records
```

* Using conditions while doing update/delete work:
```ruby
# update users set description = 'He is a boy!' where gender = 0
lht.users.update({gender: 0}, set: {description: 'He is a boy!'})

# delete from users where gender = 0
lht.users.delete({gender: 0})
```

### Command Line
Some command line completion functions have been implemented so that when you turn into command line, you can click TAB button to complete commands or namesã€‚

For instance, you have a Mysql database instance, where you have some tables as follow:  
![image](https://github.com/Niatruc/zombiehome/blob/master/pic/tables.jpg)

After executing `connnect` (or `c` for short) command to connect to your database, you can click `Tab` button to complete your datatbase's or tables' or other variables' or methods' names. As in the follow gif, I use `Tab` button to quickly refer to `users` table and query its records.

You can use `cd` command to change the conversation's context. As follow shows, after turning into `db.tables.users` table's context, when typing `select` and enter, it will fetch records from `db.tables.users` table. And if you just type `cd` and enter, it will return to the top level context (which is the same as that context you are first in after lauching this program).

Using conditions when query records will be like this:
